# voting-methods
New voting methods, some of which pass combinations of properties no other known methods do.

For now there are two directories:
- bucklin\_range: An old Bucklin-Range hybrid multiwinner method based on an approximation of the k-median problem.
- top\_vote\_path: TVP, a method that both elects from the resistant set and is monotone. Other methods, like IRV, that elect from the resistant set and enjoy low coalitional manipulability fail monotonicity; TVP shows that the two properties are compatible.
