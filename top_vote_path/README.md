This directory contains a Python implementation of the "Top Vote Path" method
that elects from the [resistant set](https://electowiki.org/wiki/Resistant_set) and passes monotonicity ([mono-raise](https://electowiki.org/wiki/Monotonicity#Mono-raise_criterion)).

As far as I know, no other method passes both of these criteria.

The implementation is somewhat terse in how the method itself works and why it works. I may add something more formal later, but this [Election-Methods mailing list post](http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com//2025-August/007033.html) gives the general reasoning.
